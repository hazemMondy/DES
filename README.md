DES
====

encryption - decryption algorithm implementation in C++
implementation in two ways 
- using strings libirary
- using bits operations very fast less than 20K cpu cycles

Pre-requisites
--------------

- iostream
- bits/stdc++.h
- vector
- map
- string
- iterator
- alg
- math
- bitset
- sstream
- assert
- stdlib.h


Getting Started
---------------

- the methods are overloaded so you could either use it in strings or in the optimized way in bits operations

- get the key and text and the operation type and perform the desired operation.
